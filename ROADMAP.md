# Photo Sorter Roadmap

This document outlines planned features and improvements for future versions of Photo Sorter in order to improve usability and performance.

## Upcoming Features

- **Undo Last Action**
  - Allow users to undo the last move or sorting action, restoring the previous state and location of the image.

- **Image Rotation Support**
  - Auto-detect image orientation using metadata and rotate images automatically if needed.
  - Provide manual controls for users to rotate images within the app before sorting.

- **Resizable Image Display Area**
  - Enable users to dynamically adjust the size of the image preview area for better viewing, especially on larger screens.

- **Photo Renaming by Category**
  - Add an option to automatically rename photos based on the selected category, with customizable naming patterns.

- **Button Icons**
  - Enhance the visual appearance of category and navigation buttons by adding icons. (Note: This is currently limited by the UI framework, but will be revisited as soon as support is available.)

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - Further optimize image loading, thumbnail generation, and UI responsiveness to ensure lightning-fast operation, even with large photo collections.

## Additional Ideas

- Support for more image formats and RAW files.
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts.
